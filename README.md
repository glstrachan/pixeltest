# Building and Running PixelTest

## Prerequisites

Before building and running PixelTest, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **CMake**: Required for configuring and generating the build files. Visit [CMake's official download page](https://cmake.org/download/) for installation instructions.

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glstrachan/pixeltest.git
cd pixeltest
```

## Building the Project

From the root directory of the project, create a new directory for the build files and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

Configure the project using CMake. This command generates the necessary build files:

```bash
cmake ..
```

Now, compile the project:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

This will create an executable in the `build` directory.

## Running the Executable ðŸŽŠ

It's crucial to run the executable from the root directory of the project to ensure it can correctly locate the shaders and assets. Navigate back to the root directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

Run the executable from the root directory:

```bash
./build/PixelTest
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues related to missing shaders or assets, confirm that you're running the executable from the project's root directory.
- Ensure all dependencies, including CMake, are correctly installed and up-to-date.

For more help or information, please refer to the project's README or contact the project maintainers.
